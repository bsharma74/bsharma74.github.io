I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at University of California, Santa Cruz. My primary fields of interest are Macroeconomics and Financial Economics, with a focus on climate change.

My research is focused on how firms, households, and financial institutions make decisions regarding climate risk mitigation and adaptation in the context of (i) lack of information about climate change and (ii) behavioral biases such as under-reaction in response to available information.

I am also interested in leveraging increasingly available microdata across developed and emerging economies to inform macroeconomic models of labor market outcomes and firm expectations.
